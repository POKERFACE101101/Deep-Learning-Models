# Deep-Learning-Models

These are the DL models which I have worked with for the CIFAR-10 Dataset.

ResNet9 - > Residual Network 9 Model uses 8 Convolutional Layers & 1 Fully Connected Linear Layer (92.63% Accuracy)

VGG16 -> Visual Geometry Group 16 Model uses 13 Convolutional Layers & 3 Fully Connected Linear Layers (92.17% Accuracy)

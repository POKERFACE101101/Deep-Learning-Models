# Deep-Learning-Models

These are the DL models which I have worked with for the CIFAR-10 Dataset.

1. ResNet-9 - > Residual Network 9 Model uses 8 Convolutional Layers & 1 Fully Connected Linear Layer (92.63% Accuracy)

2. VGG-16 -> Visual Geometry Group 16 Model uses 13 Convolutional Layers & 3 Fully Connected Linear Layers (92.17% Accuracy)

3. AlexNet -> AlexNet Model uses 5 Convolutional Layers & 3 Fully Connected Linear Layers (86.94% Accuracy)

4. LeNet -> LeNet Model uses 2 Convolutional Layers & 3 Fully Connected Linear Layers (76.7% Accuracy)

The ResNet-9 & VGG-16 perform above 90% due to the complexity of the model as it involves a larger number of convolutional layers. The AlexNet & LeNet are simple models so their accuracies are ~87% and ~77% Respectively.
